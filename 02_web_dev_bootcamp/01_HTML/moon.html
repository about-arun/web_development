      <p>
        The <b>Moon</b> is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth's</a> only natural
        satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the
        width of Australia),[16] it is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar
        System, the largest satellite in the Solar System relative to its major
        planet,[f] and larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a
        planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it
        a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It
        lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its
        surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g). Jupiter's moon
        Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher
        surface gravity and density.

        Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or
        about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence very slowly
        lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The
        Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During
        each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface
        illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar
        phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon
        is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full
        rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near
        side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the
        same as the synodic period. That said, 59% of the total lunar surface
        can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.

      <p>
        The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed
        4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a
        giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body
        called Theia. It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal
        interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark
        volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient
        crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of the large impact
        basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period,
        some three billion years ago. The lunar surface is relatively
        non-reflective, with a reflectance just slightly brighter than that of
        worn asphalt. However, because it has a large angular diameter, the full
        moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's
        apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to
        cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.

        Both the Moon's prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of
        phases have provided cultural references and influences for human
        societies throughout history. Such influences can be found in language,
        calendar systems, art, and mythology. The first artificial object to
        reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in
        1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9
        in 1966. The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the
        United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface
        between 1969 and 1972. These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar
        rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding
        of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history.

      <h2>Name and etymology</h2>
      <p>
        The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply
        Moon, with a capital M.[18][19] The noun moon is derived from Old
        English mōna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from
        Proto-Germanic *mēnōn,[20] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European
        *mēnsis "month"[21] (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive *mēneses) which may
        be related to the verb "measure" (of time).[22] Occasionally, the name
        Luna /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[23] and especially in
        science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in
        poetry "Luna" has been used to denote personification of the Moon.[24]
        Cynthia /ˈsɪnθiə/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon
        personified as a goddess,[25] while Selene /səˈliːniː/ (literally
        "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon. The usual English adjective
        pertaining to the Moon is "lunar", derived from the Latin word for the
        Moon, lūna. The adjective selenian /səliːniən/,[26] derived from the
        Greek word for the Moon, σελήνη selēnē, and used to describe the Moon as
        a world rather than as an object in the sky, is rare,[27] while its
        cognate selenic was originally a rare synonym[28] but now nearly always
        refers to the chemical element selenium.[29] The Greek word for the Moon
        does however provide us with the prefix seleno-, as in selenography, the
        study of the physical features of the Moon, as well as the element name
        selenium.[30][31] The Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt,
        Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols was the Moon
        and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called
        Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[32] These names
        – Luna, Cynthia and Selene – are reflected in technical terms for lunar
        orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and selenocentric. The astronomical
        symbol for the Moon is a crescent, ☾, for example in M☾ 'lunar mass'
        (also ML).

      <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching,
        with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to
        gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated
        than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates
        that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to
        the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its
        orbit.[58]

      <h3>Size and mass</h3>
      <p>
        The Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the
        Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making
        it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[17]
        It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest
        dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon
        Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[g][59]
        the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative
        to their primary planets.[h] The Moon's diameter is about 3,500 km, more
        than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the
        width of Australia.[16] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38
        million square kilometers, slightly less than the area of the Americas
        (North and South America). The Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[60] being
        the second densest among the planetary moons, having the second highest
        surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654 g and an escape velocity of 2.38
        km/s (8600 km/h; 5300 mph).
      </p>
      <h3>Internal structure</h3>
      <p>
        The Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic
        equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.[61] It has a
        geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid
        iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres
        (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a
        radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190 mi). Around the core is a
        partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres
        (310 mi).[62][63] This structure is thought to have developed through
        the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the
        Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.[64] Crystallization of this
        magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and
        sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after
        about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density
        plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop.[65] The
        final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched
        between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and
        heat-producing elements.[1] Consistent with this perspective,
        geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly
        anorthosite.[15] The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted
        onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic
        mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.[1] The
        crust is on average about 50 kilometres (31 mi) thick.[1] The Moon is
        the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[66] However,
        the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350
        kilometres (220 mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon.
        Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron
        alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's
        time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[67]
        The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5 GPa (49,000
        atm).[68]
